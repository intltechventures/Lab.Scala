Chapter-1: A Scalable Language
* Actor class allows passing messages
	* Syntax: {receiving object} ! {message}
	* ! is a method of the Actor class
* Traits are like Java Interfaces, but can include method implementation details - as well as field definitions.
* Objects are consructed by ```mixin composition```
	* "takes members of a class and adds members of a number of traits to them"
	* Different aspects of classes can be encapsulated in different traits - sort of like multiple inheritance...
